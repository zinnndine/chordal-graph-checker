# Chordal Graph Checker

# Chordal Graph Checker with GUI

A Python application with a PySide6 graphical interface that checks whether a given graph is **chordal** using classical graph algorithms.

---

## Problem Statement

Chordal graphs are an important class of graphs in graph theory and optimization, characterized by the absence of induced cycles of length greater than three.  
They play a key role in **perfect graphs**.

This project determines whether an input graph is chordal and provides a simple visualization interface.

## Algorithm Used

- **Maximum Cardinality Search (MCS)**

## Implementation Details

- Language: **Python**
- GUI: **PySide6**
---

## How to Run (linux)

```bash
python3 chordal_checker.py
